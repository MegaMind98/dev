To complete your team profile:

1. 	Make a copy of this file and name it firstname_lastname.md. 
	Open that file and edit it. Don't edit this original TEMPLATE file.

2. 	Copy a photo of yourself to the /img/class/ directory. Name 
	it using the firstname_lastname format. Make sure it is a
	square photo, if you look flat that's probably because the picture
	isn't square.
	
3. 	Fill out the above fields as per the instructions below:
	
	- firstname/lastname: Your name as you want it displayed on the 
	members page 
	
	- photo: Filename of the photo you just added to the /img/class/ 
	directory. 		  
	
	- place: Where you've come from, this is important. We're looking 
	forward to visiting your place soon or later, that's why.
    
	- email: Your email address or leave it blank if you don't want to 
	share.
    
	- phonenumber: 'Your', phone number. This field is optional too.
	
	- website: If you've website, we provide backlink to your website. :D
    
	- facebook: Your facebook url(like https://facebook.com/username). 
	It's all up to you if you wish to include or not.
    
	- twitter: Your twitter url(like https://twitter.com/username). This is an
   	optional field.
    
	- linkedin: Link to your LinkedIn profile. Optional!  
    
	- instagram: Link to your Instagram and this is not strict as well. Optional!
	
	- github: Link to your GitHub Page. Of course, optional!
    
	- memberid: In the future if we wish to manually sort the names, this 
	could be a option. For now type in your favorite number.
