To complete your team profile:

1. 	Make a copy of this file and name it firstname_lastname.md. 
	Open that file and edit it. Don't edit this original TEMPLATE file.

2. 	Copy a photo of yourself to the /img/class/ directory. Name 
	it using the firstname_lastname format. Make sure it is a
	square photo, if you look flat that's probably because the picture
	isn't square.

	- firstname/lastname: Your name as you want it displayed on the 
	members page 
	
	- photo: Filename of the photo you just added to the /img/class/ 
	directory. 		  
	
	- place: Where you've come from, this is important. We're looking 
	forward to visiting your place soon or later, that's why.
    
	- email: Your email address or leave it blank if you don't want to

   	optional field.
    
	- linkedin: Link to your LinkedIn profile. Optional!  
    
	- instagram: Link to your Instagram and this is not strict as well. Optional!
	
	- github: Link to your GitHub Page. Of course, optional!
