1. 	Make a copy of this file and name it firstname_lastname.md. 
	Open that file and edit it. Don't edit this original TEMPLATE file.

2. 	Copy a photo of yourself to the /img/class/ directory. Name 
	it using the firstname_lastname format. Make sure it is a

	directory. 		  
	
	- place: Where you've come from, this is important. We're looking 
	forward to visiting your place soon or later, that's why.
