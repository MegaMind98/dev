        <p><strong>Participants must agree upon the below mentioned rules and regulations:</strong></p>

<p>Team Captains are required to update the admin beforehand, provide full details on players and stand-ins. This includes full name, in-game nickname, and steam account.</p>

<p>Each team must have 5 players and one stand-in player. The Stand-In player cannot be an existing player of the tournament (even if the player was eliminated in an earlier stage).</p>

<p>A knife round will be played to determine the sides. This is forced by the server. The winner of this knife round will choose the side by typing .stay or .switch in the chat.</p>

<p>If the server crashes before completion of the three rounds(in a half), the server must be restarted and the half’s score will be reset to 0-0.</p>

<p>If the server crashes after the third round, the half must be restarted with start money 2000 and the score will be counted from the last completed round. The start money will be set to 2000 and the team that lose the last round kills itself using “kill” in the console. This round will not be counted. The half continues with the following round and the start money has to be set to 800 again.</p>

</p>If a player drops, the server will be paused at the end of the current round.</p>

<p>The waiting time for a dropped player is 15 minutes. If the player or a substitute rejoins the server and both teams are ready, the game will be resumed. In case the dropped player does not reconnect within 15 minutes and there are no substitute available, the team must continue playing with one less player.</p>

<p><strong>Foul language, offensive, and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated from any player and will result in the following:</strong><p>
    <p>First Warning that the team captain has to acknowledge.</p>
    <p>Second Warning will lead to forfeiting of the game.</p>
